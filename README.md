# big_data_ee_drought_monitor
This is the python code used for a study on drought monitoring with the use of Google Earth Engine big data. This study is created in the context of my postgrad.

## Code for the study on drought monitor for Larissa, Thessaly, GR
### With the use of MODIS data and Google Earth Engine platform

This code was created for a postgrad semester a study for drought monitoring in Larissa perfecture in Greece. The study was based on data from MODIS sensor on Terra satellites. For the study plots and visualizations where created for the following indexes:
- Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDVI)
- Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)
- Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI)
- Normalized MultiBand Drought Index (NMDI)
- Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI)
- Vegetation Condition Index (VCI)
- Land Surface Temperature (LST)
- Temperature Condition Index (TCI)
- Vegetation Health Index (VHI)

The scope of this repo is not to present the analysis and the conclusions of the study, just the code used for it.
